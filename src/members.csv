1,Arash Zakeresfahani,azakeres@iu.edu,He/His/Him,I am a third year Ph.D. student at the Healthcare Journeys Lab. My research interest is identifying pregnancy related resources and learning about communities of care providers. The most enjoyable part of my work is when I get to directly interact with my study participants and learn about their experiences. I like to explain my research to them and work with them to design technologies that could enhance their practices.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/arash-zakeresfahani-05247017a/,https://www.instagram.com/arashzaker/,https://www.facebook.com/arash.zaker,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sd7V5p5xA55SbbAL2lk2Be0jnG3x7AhW/view?usp=sharing,https://twitter.com/ArashZaker,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azakeres/LabReactWebsite/master/src/images/Arash_Zaker.png,"rgba(88,185,214,0.9)","rgba(253,158,99,0.9)"
